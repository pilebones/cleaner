# Pilebones's Cleaner

## History and context

When I started to programming a very long time ago, I had the idea to make a CCleaner like using CLI only named `Pilebones's Cleaner`. At this time, I didn't know linux and good practice for programming language, I spent major of time on Windows to play to some video-games but I was really excited about code my first self-taught program on my first programming language.

For this reason don't be too critical about code-quality. 
I push this code on Github to purpose a simple but complete example of batch scripting which use some tricks of this spooky language.

## Support and troubleshooting

Tested using x86 & x64 compiled version of Windows XP and Vista.
Should be tested on Windows 7 and 10.

## How to execute this script

Using GUI : you should run `Pilebones's Cleaner.bat` using double click from the window panel of the directory of the project.
Using CLI : you should press `WIN+R` then type `cmd.exe`, go to the directory of the project then exec `Pilebones's Cleaner.bat`.
